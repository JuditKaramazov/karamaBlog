Love won. [Matt Biilmann](https://www.netlify.com/blog/authors/matt-biilmann/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)'s co-founder and CEO, recently announced their new partnership with [Astro](https://astro.build), ensuring more collaboration, features, and an _even_ better developer experience. Although several new core primitives from both Netlify and Astro will be announced soon, there is no doubt that further development of such a phenomenal open-source framework will make the whole web ecosystem stronger.

Rightly, Biilmann highlighted Astro's flexibility as one of its most valuable sides: Astro leans in on the web platform, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but does not prescribe any specific component system or UI framework for its [interactive islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) - widgets floating in a sea of otherwise static, lightweight, server-rendered HTML. React? Vue? Svelte? Lit? Mix and match libraries? Everything is possible, and _that_ elevates Astro as an exceptional framework for content-driven sites (with any level of interactivity), making it easy to build incredibly performant sites.

As we already knew, Netlify actively supported Astro’s work to bring [Server Islands](https://astro.build/blog/future-of-astro-server-islands/) later this year. This fact ultimately results in the endless possibilities of websites that load instantly with static “page shells” served from our global CDN, and dynamic islands loaded separately. We'll see how this collaboration evolves, but joining forces to guarantee that Netlify users have a great experience with Server Islands as Astro moves towards a public, non-experimental launch sounds like love indeed won this time.

> Astro has long been one of my own favorite web frameworks and I’ve built countless PoC’s, demos, experiments, and examples with it. Last year we shared that Astro was the leader in framework growth and satisfaction according to the results of our 2023 State of Web Development report. At a time when the most popular Jamstack frameworks evolved from simpler origins to very complex systems, with countless rendering modes, complex JavaScript hydration models, complicated caching modes, and a stronger and stronger sense of vendor lock-in, Astro has been a breath of fresh air with its focus on simplicity and content-driven websites. At Netlify we’re excited to partner with the Astro team to help developers create and unlock the power of the web.
